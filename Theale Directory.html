<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>Directory of profiles for members of the Rickmansworth and Theale Audatex offices. You are able to add profiles to the Rickmansworth database and view profiles from the Theale database. The Theale version of this directory will do the opposite. You will also be able to sort the profiles and also search for specific profiles too.</p>

<h3>Who made it?</h3>
<p>This directory has been made by Josh and Adil who are both Java Developer Apprentices who have been at Audatex for 3 weeks. We have chosen this colour scheme as it fits in with the Solera style and we have used the font and

buttons for a clear and attractive viewing. Sentences just to fill up the page just to make it look a bit more professional. No need to keep reading. Football predictions for tonight: City will beat Napoli 3-2. Spurs win 2-1 against madrid as long as Kane is fit and starts. Liverpool 5-0 win similar to last time. Watford game predictions for the weekend: Watford 3-1 win against everton. Undeserved loss against Stoke who put 11 men behind the ball for 90 minutes which we need to bounce back from so the boys will put in a good performance against a stuggling everton side.
